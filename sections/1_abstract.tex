This paper presents a study of a deep reinforcement learning technique that uses a Soft Actor Critic network for application in navigation of mobile robots.
In order to make the robot to arrive to a target on a map, the network has 10 laser range findings, the previous linear and angular velocity, and relative position and angle of the mobile robot to the target are the network inputs. As outputs, the network has the linear and angular velocity.
From the results analysis, it is possible to conclude that the deep reinforcement learning algorithms, with continuous actions, are effective for decision-make of a robotic vehicle. 
However, it is necessary to create a good reward system for the intelligent agent to accomplish your objectives.
In order to show the performance of the Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we have applied  successfully the proposed architecture in experiments with a simulated and a real robot in two different environments.
